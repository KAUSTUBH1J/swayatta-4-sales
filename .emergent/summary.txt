The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and built the core Sales module for the Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) system. The work began with a clear problem statement to extend existing User Management (RBAC) with Company Formation and Contact Management flows, adhering to existing FastAPI (PostgreSQL + Alembic) and React (Tailwind, Radix UI, shadcn/ui) patterns.

Key challenges encountered included initial environment setup (unzipping, path navigation), database migration (PostgreSQL setup, Alembic initialization, foreign key issues), and a significant portion of the effort was dedicated to resolving frontend-backend integration issues, particularly concerning environment variable loading, server conflicts, and proper authentication flow in both local and preview environments. The AI diligently created models, schemas, services, and API endpoints for the Sales module, and integrated them into the existing codebase. Frontend pages and components were also developed. The critical hurdle was ensuring the frontend correctly communicated with the *active* backend server, leading to temporary hardcoding of URLs and the eventual modification of the MongoDB-based  to house authentication and the new Sales APIs for the preview environment. The current state is focused on populating dummy data for existing modules to enable full frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to extend an existing Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) system, which currently features User Management (RBAC), by adding a new **Sales module**. This module will encompass **Company Formation** and **Contact Management** functionalities. The implementation must strictly adhere to the established backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic) and frontend (React 19, Tailwind, Radix UI, shadcn/ui) architectural patterns, including JWT authentication and existing RBAC enforcement.

The Sales module requires:
1.  **Company Formation:** Capturing general info (GST No, PAN No, Industry Segment, Company Name, Website, Is Child, Parent Company), Account Details (Account Type, Sub Type, Business Type, Account Region), Company Profile (Rich text), multi-row Addresses, multi-row Turnover, optional multi-row Profit, and multi-row Documents (upload with type/description).
2.  **Contact Creation:** General info (Title, First/Middle/Last Name, DOB, linked Company, Designation, Email, Fax, Primary/Secondary/Alternate No), Communication Preferences (Don’t Solicit/Mail/Fax/Email/Call), and multi-row Addresses.
3.  **Relationships:** One-to-many (Company → Contacts), parent-child companies, contacts inheriting context, and configurable cascade/restrict delete on company deletion.
4.  **Masters:** All dropdowns must be API-driven from master tables (, , etc.) with a standard schema.
5.  **Backend Structure:** New  and  folders, reusing CRUD and RBAC patterns. Alembic migrations for new tables (, , , etc.).
6.  **Frontend Structure:** Add Sales parent menu (dynamically from ), Companies listing (), Contacts listing () with search, pagination, and forms, replicating User Management UI/UX.
7.  **Dashboards:** Company-wise contact count, contact distribution, company revenue vs. contact engagement, with date range, region, industry filters, and CSV/PDF export.
8.  **Workflow & RBAC:** Admin creates companies/contacts. All listings are backend-driven. RBAC enforces access control.
9.  **Menu Integration**: Sales module menus (Companies, Contacts) must be returned in the  API response with .

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The database is PostgreSQL, managed with SQLAlchemy and Alembic. Authentication is handled using JWT.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/app/models/sales/**: New directory for SQLAlchemy models related to Company, Contact, and their associated data (Address, Turnover, Profit, Document). This defines the database structure for the new Sales module.
*   **/app/backend/app/schemas/sales/**: New directory for Pydantic schemas used for request/response validation and serialization in the FastAPI application. Includes schemas for all CRUD operations and nested data structures.
*   **/app/backend/app/services/sales/**: New directory containing the business logic for handling Company and Contact related operations, interacting with the models and performing CRUD.
*   **/app/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/sales/**: New directory housing the FastAPI endpoint definitions for Companies and Contacts, including RBAC checks, search, pagination, and export.
*   **/app/backend/app/routers/api.py**: Modified to include the new , making the Sales API endpoints accessible.
*   **/app/backend/migration/env.py**: Modified to ensure all new SQLAlchemy models are imported and registered with Alembic for migration generation.
*   **/app/backend/config/.env**: Modified to correct PostgreSQL database credentials, crucial for successful database connection and migrations.
*   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Updated to include , , and  for database migrations and API testing.
*   **/app/backend/server.py**: This file was initially a placeholder or a different application (MongoDB-based). It was heavily modified to include authentication endpoints and Sales API endpoints (using in-memory data for auth) to make the backend functional for the preview environment when the full PostgreSQL setup wasn't readily available or accessible.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Modified to integrate the new React routes for  and , ensuring they are part of the main application's routing.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/sales/**: New directory containing the main React pages for Companies () and Contacts (), which display data tables and manage state.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/sales/components/**: New directory for reusable React components like  and , featuring multi-row input fields and tabbed interfaces.
*   **/app/frontend/src/services/salesService.js**: New service file acting as an API client for the frontend, handling all HTTP requests to the backend Sales endpoints.
*   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**: Modified to dynamically configure the , crucial for switching between local development and the preview environment. It was also temporarily hardcoded for specific debugging.
*   **/app/frontend/.env**: Updated with  to point to the correct backend server (local test server or preview domain).

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is addressing the issue where the frontend in the preview environment (accessed via ) is unable to login or display data for existing modules (Users, Roles, etc.).

The root cause identified is that the preview environment is running the original  (which was a basic MongoDB-based server) on port 8001, and this server lacks the full User Management and Sales module APIs, including authentication. While the AI successfully implemented the Sales module with a PostgreSQL backend, that backend was not accessible or running in the preview environment.

To resolve this, the AI has pivoted to modifying the *existing*  (the one running on port 8001 in preview) to temporarily serve both the authentication and the Sales API endpoints. This involves:
1.  **Modifying **: Adding authentication endpoints (, ) and Sales module endpoints (Company, Contact) to this file. The authentication uses in-memory  and  for simplicity in the preview environment.
2.  **Updating **: Ensuring the frontend dynamically uses the correct backend URL (the preview domain) instead of , which is inaccessible from the preview browser.
3.  **Restarting Backend**: Using backend: stopped
backend: started to apply changes to the  running in the preview environment.

The immediate work is focused on making sure all necessary User Management (Users, Roles, Departments etc.) API endpoints are available within the modified  and populated with dummy data, so the frontend can correctly display data for *all* modules, not just Sales. This is being done by adding new routes and in-memory data structures to . The AI has successfully added the authentication and basic sales endpoints to  and confirmed they are accessible via the preview domain. The current step involves further extending  to include dummy data and endpoints for the User Management modules.
